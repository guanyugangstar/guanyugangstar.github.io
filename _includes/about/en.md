Hey, I'm Guan (Email: guanyugangstar@outlook.com), a "slash" composed uncle who loves reading, philosophical thinking, food, movies, and also has a smattering of computer science. I consider myself an occasional "free - style" enthusiast with bursts of literary inspiration.

From October 2021 for a period of time, some unexpected little ripples emerged in my life. By chance, I got the idea of writing. So, in my beloved city - Nanjing, China, I quietly left my footprints at some off - the - beaten - path scenic spots. I observed, recorded, and reflected. As I delved deeper into writing, I gained a new perspective on the world around me, and my life added a bit more depth...

Years later, when I reread these records, I can't help but sigh at the fleeting time and the changes of all things. In order to preserve these memories for a long time, I've "settled down" in this corner and placed some of the essays from that period here as a memento of that unforgettable past.

### Special Thanks
Thanks to classmate Huang Xuan for providing the project template, which helped me fulfill this wish. After in - depth study of the project, I deeply felt the hardships that Huang Xuan put into web design. I'm very lucky to have "connected" with this technical expert. At the same time, I also especially thank the domestic up - master "Technical PaPaXia" for his guidance, which enabled me to discover this treasure of Huang Xuan.
